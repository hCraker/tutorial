# Welcome!
This is a repository to hold tutorials that I'm working on.

## Python Basics
The Python Basics tutorial only requires you to have Jupyter installed. You can do this via [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) by creating a simple conda evironment.

Type the following into your command line once you have conda installed.
```
conda create -n python-basics jupyter
conda activate python-basics
jupyter notebook
```

This will open up a jupyter notebook in your browser. Navigate to the python_tutorial.ipynb file, and you're good to go!
